            <p className="mt-3" style={{ fontWeight: 400, fontSize: 18 }}>
              A skincare range refers to a collection of skincare products
              designed to work together to improve skin health. These ranges
              typically include cleansers, toners, moisturizers, serums,
              sunscreens & special treatments. Deciphering a skincare routine is
              overwhelming at times. With so many options available, it becomes
              tough to understand what your skin truly needs. Our sedentary
              lifestyle has impacted skin's health, leaving it dull and damaged.
              With the Goodness of Nature, it is possible to help protect the
              skin, boost radiance, prevent blemishes, and reverse the damage.
              You can check Mitvana’ s product list as our top-of-the-line
              organic products come enriched with natural ingredients at great
              prices to help you achieve a radiant complexion.
